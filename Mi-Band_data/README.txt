This dataset contains the data from my MiBand fitness tracker.

NB: Actually I had to bands - MiBand2 and MiBand3 (currently). The information is extracted from MiFit android app. I don't really know if the model matters when it comes to reliability of data.

The dataset can be used for classification and regression problems, i.g. 'classification of the day by number of steps' OR 'prediction of the number of steps given a day'

There are six columns in the dataset:
steps,distance,runDistance,calories,date,day
